# Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. 


## 2. Advantages of React
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.
- **Reusable Components**: Components can be reused across different parts of an application, reducing code duplication.
- **Strong Community Support**: React has a large community and a wealth of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries.

## 3. Disadvantages of React
- **Learning Curve**: React has a steep learning curve, especially for beginners who are not familiar with JavaScript ES6 and JSX.
- **Boilerplate Code**: Setting up a React project can involve a lot of boilerplate code and configuration.
- **Rapid Changes**: The React ecosystem evolves quickly, which can make it challenging to keep up with the latest best practices and updates.

## 4. Difference Between Real DOM and Virtual DOM
- **Real DOM**: The Real DOM updates the entire tree structure of HTML tags, which can be slow and inefficient for large applications.
- **Virtual DOM**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the Real DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to batch updates and apply them efficiently, improving performance.
